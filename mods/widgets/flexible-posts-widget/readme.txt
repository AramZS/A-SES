An advanced posts display widget with many options. Display posts in your sidebars any way you'd like!

== Description ==
The default Recent Posts widget is exceptionally basic. I always find myself in need of a way to easily display a selection of posts from any combination post type or taxonomy. Hence, Flexible Post Widget.

Flexible Posts Widget (FPW) is more than just a simple alternative to the default Recent Posts widget.  With many per-instance options it is highly customizable and allows advanced users to display the resulting posts virtually any way imaginable. 

Version 3.0 is a major enhancement as widgets can now get posts by *BOTH* post type and/or taxonomy & term as well as select *multiple* post types and terms.  Previous versions of the plugin only allowed post type OR taxonomy & term queries, not both.

= Features & options =
* Customizable widget title
* Get posts via post type(s) and/or taxonomy & term(s).
* Control the number of posts displayed and the number of posts to offset.
* Option to display the post feature image.
* Select the post feature image size to display from existing image sizes: thumbnail, medium, large, post-thumbnail or any size defined by the current theme.
* Order posts by: date, ID, title, menu order, random; and sort posts: ascending or descending.
* Each widget's output can be customized by user-defined templates added to the current theme folder.

= Supported Languages =
* English
* Spanish


== Installation ==
1. Upload the `flexible-posts-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to 'Appearance' > 'Widgets' and place the widget into a sidebar to configure it.

= To use a custom HTML output template =
1. Create a folder called `flexible-posts-widget` in the root of your theme folder.
1. Copy `widget.php` from within the plugin's `views` folder into your theme's new `flexible-posts-widget` folder.
1. Optional: Rename your theme's `widget.php` template file to a name of your choice (to use different templates for each widget instance).
1. Go to 'Appearance' > 'Widgets' in WordPress to configure an instance of the widget.
1. In the 'Template Filename' field enter the name of the template file you added to your theme. Example: `my-themes-widget.php`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I display custom fields (custom meta values) with FPW? =
You'll want to create a custom HTML template by following [the instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flexible-posts-widget/installation/ "View instructions for creating custom FPW templates") and then you can use the standard WordPress [Custom Field](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields "View custom field functions on the WordPress Codex") functions the same way you would if you were editing your theme's other template files.

A simple code example for a custom field named "test_field" _might_ look like the following:
`$test_field_value = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'test_field', true );
echo $test_field_value;`

= How can I style the images, titles or other widget output a certain way? =
FPW intentionally does NOT add any styling of it's own.  To adjust the font size, color, alignment, image size, etc. of any output from this widget, you'll need to edit your theme's styles.

= Does this plugin/widget insert any styles or scripts into my site? =
FPW does not add styles or scripts to your public theme.  The plugin is intentionally designed to work within your existing theme.  FPW does add one stylesheet and one JavaScript to the Widgets page in wp-admin to help with the administration of any FPWs in use.

= Want to add support for another language? =
I'd love to support more languages.  Feel free to post PO & MO files for your language to a [new forum thread](http://wordpress.org/tags/flexible-posts-widget/) and I'll get them added to the plugin.

1. An example of posts displayed using WordPress's TwentyTwelve theme and the default Feature Image (post-thumbnail) size.  This demonstrates how the plugin looks out-of-the-box with no user-customized styling or output in a default theme.
1. In the Wild: FPW displaying a selection of featured beers (Post Type: Brew) over at http://canalparkbrewery.com.  This example uses slightly customized output and some theme-specific styles. 
1. In the wild: FPW displaying a selection media attachments, with custom thumbnails.  This example uses highly customized HTML output and very theme-specific styles.
1. In the wild: FPW displaying several posts over at http://chnl7700.mnsu.edu.  Also highly customized output and theme styles.

== Upgrade Notice ==
When upgrading from one major version to another (version 1.x to version 2.x to version 3.x, etc), please remember to verify your settings for any existing widgets.  Not all settings combinations will be saved after a major release upgrade.


== Other Notes ==
= Upgrading from one major version to another =
When upgrading between major releases (version 1.x to version 2.x to version 3.x, etc), please remember to verify your settings for any existing widgets.  Not all settings combinations will be saved after a major release upgrade.

= Default vs. Custom Templates =
FPW comes with a default template for the widget output. If you would like to alter the widget display code, create a new folder called `flexible-posts-widget` in your template directory and copy over the "views/widget.php" file.

Edit the new file in your theme to your desired HTML layout. Please do not edit the one in the plugin folder as that will cause conflicts when you update the plugin to the latest release.

= Future updates & feature requests list =
* Add a CSS class field to be applied to each widget in a (non-existant) Advanced section.
* Dynamically populate the "Template Filename" field based on the templates available.
* Add filters & hooks for other plugins.
* Add shortcode functionality.
* Allow shortcode output to dynamically load more posts (AJAX-ified).
